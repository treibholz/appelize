This program "appelizes" your music into a separate directory.

It recodes audio files that don't work in the Apple world (like FLAC and OGG)
and hardlinks the unknown ones (like mp3, jpeg and so on...). The result is a
space saving copy of your music.

In fact, it's also quite usefull for other mobile device with limited space
(e.g. android phone or notebook with an expensive SSD) or limited capabilities
(e.g. Car HiFi devices or cheap mp3 players).

It recodes all FLACs and OGGs to either mp3 or m4a (AAC).



Here is another example of how you might use it:

# appelize -s ~/Music -d ~/.androidmusic/ --no-ogg 
# appelize -s ~/.androidmusic/ ~/.applemusic -e faac

After this you have two new directories:

~/.androidmusic contains hardlinks of everything but your FLAC-Files, which
are now encoded to mp3

~/.applemusic contains hardlinks to the upper, except all your OGGs, which
are now recoded to m4a.
